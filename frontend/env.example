# For local development: Leave empty - code will automatically use Vite proxy
# For production (Netlify): Set to your backend URL (without /api, it will be added automatically)
# Example: VITE_API_URL=https://devzora-control-center.onrender.com
# 
# Note: The code automatically detects development vs production mode
# - Development: Uses /api (Vite proxy to localhost:3001)
# - Production: Uses VITE_API_URL if set, otherwise falls back to production URL
VITE_API_URL=
